    <h2>Coming soon to theatres, a new Ruby thriller is born.</h2>
    <p>The Dark side of the tracks.</p>
    <h2>《The Rails Syndicate》</h2>
    <p>Deep in the western outskirts of Tokyo, where abandoned train lines wind through overgrown trees, sat an old red locomotive covered in wild graffiti. Locals called it “The Commit Train.”</p>

    <p>No one used the tracks anymore, except for a curious group who met there most nights: The Rails Syndicate, a crew of eccentric but harmless tech misfits who took their devotion to Ruby on Rails a little too seriously.</p>

    <p>The Syndicate wasn’t a real gang — not in the dangerous sense. But in their own minds, they ran Tokyo’s underground… developer meetup ecosystem.</p>

    <h3>The Crew</h3>

    <ul class="crew-list">
      <li><strong>Boss Hashim</strong> – The leader, always muttering things like “bundle install your life, kid.”</li>
      <li><strong>Migrate Mahmud</strong> – Obsessed with reorganizing anything in sight. Couldn’t enter a room without whispering, “We need to restructure this schema…”</li>
      <li><strong>Controller Clare</strong> – The strategist, mapping all plans out like routes in a Rails app.</li>
      <li><strong>Master Model Scooter</strong> – The stealthy one who documented everything in perfect YAML and makes sure no detail is overlooked.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="spaced">Their Mission</h3>

    <p>Every weekend, the Rails Syndicate gathered inside the old train to work on their legendary project: TokyoTransit, a Ruby on Rails app that would accurately predict which train cars were likely to be crowded, noisy, quiet, or awkward based on live commuter patterns.</p>

    <p>Their goal wasn’t fame or money — it was simply to be known as “the crew that shipped the most beautifully written code in Tokyo.”</p>

    <p>They treated the abandoned locomotive like their headquarters. The graffiti on the side? Their tag — a stylized “Ruby” written as if the letters themselves were on rails.</p>

    <h3>The Rivalry</h3>

    <p>Across town, another group existed: the JavaScript Junction CREW, who preferred flashy frameworks and constantly bragged about how “Rails is over.” The two groups weren’t hostile, but they competed fiercely each year at the Tokyo Underground Dev-Off, a quirky, semi-secret hackathon held in random places like rooftops or empty warehouses.</p>

    <h3>The Twist</h3>

    <p>This year, the Dev-Off theme was “Restore Tokyo.”</p>

    <p>While other groups built apps with edgy animations or AR features, the Rails Syndicate decided to restore something real: the abandoned locomotive that served as their HQ. However, now strange things are happening.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In Tokyo’s forgotten rail yard, a quirky group of misfit programmers calling themselves The Rails Syndicate transforms an abandoned graffiti-covered locomotive into their secret HQ. Obsessed with Ruby on Rails and harmlessly theatrical about being “gangsters,” they set out to build TokyoTransit, the most elegant commuter-prediction app ever written. When a rival JavaScript crew challenges them at the annual Dev-Off, their project unexpectedly goes viral — leading the city to restore the old train as a tech landmark. Blending humor, heart, and hacker pride, the film follows the Syndicate as they stumble into becoming unlikely Tokyo legends.</p>
